# Elan-Data-Processing
Script for cleaning raw LA-ICPMS data from ELAN software

This script will automatically clean the Elan .csv files so that they are ready for analysis with your preferred software.
Please be sure to follow the instructions provided in the slideshow to correctly import the Elan file as a .csv before running the script.
Otherwise, it may not work as intended.

In the future, additional scripts will be added here to automate some of the data analysis as well.

Please contact me regarding any issues you encounter with the script. Cheers!
